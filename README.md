CratePass (Blockchain-Based Gate Pass Dapp)
CratePass is a blockchain-powered gate pass management system built on the Stellar blockchain. This decentralized application (dApp) ensures secure, tamper-proof handling of gate passes through a smart contract written in Rust using Soroban SDK. The system offers efficient and transparent gate pass approval for both regular users and administrators.

How CratePass Got Its Name

Vision
CratePass aims to revolutionize access management by leveraging blockchain technology. It offers an efficient, transparent, and secure gate pass approval system that reduces administrative overhead, ensures real-time verification, and prevents unauthorized access.

Features
Regular Users: Register for gate passes, check pass status, and expire passes after use.
Admins: Approve or reject pass requests and manage system-wide pass statuses.
Secure Transactions: Every gate pass is managed via smart contracts, ensuring data integrity and tamper-proof operations.
Project Roadmap
Add enhanced admin authentication.
Streamline UI for a more user-friendly experience.
Reduce the need for multiple transactions during gate pass creation.
Tech Stack
Smart Contract: Rust, Soroban SDK
Blockchain: Stellar (Testnet)
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS
Wallet: Freighter Wallet for transaction management
